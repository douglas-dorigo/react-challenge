# Douglas Dorigo React Challenge

## How to run

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

## Notes

During development I had doubts about how to display the elements found in the text, because a text could contain more than one element from the periodic table, so I made a method to search in order and return only the first element found.

## Dependencies

### Styled Components

I chose to use it, to show I know how to use it and I belive that having smaller styled components which you can combine works very good on code reuse and specially with clever naming increases readability, since you do not need to read a big chunk of scss to understand what that component does.

If you have any question about the solution, please get in touch dougtech.contato@gmail.com

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm lint`

Runs ESLint for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
