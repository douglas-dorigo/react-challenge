## Project Structure

### store

I created a store folder to handle the redux config and expose some hooks. For every domain I would create a new slice. Here I hold the underlining logic and data about wich letters should be underlinde

### components

Here there is the core folder. This should hold abstract components shared among the app like buttons, inputs etc.. If I had a bigger app I would create more folders, like ui and layout, to hold ui and layouts components.

### views

Here sits all pages of the app

## Dependencies

### Styled Components

I chose to use it, to show I know how to use it and I belive that having smaller styled components which you can combine works very good on code reuse and specially with clever naming increases readability, since you do not need to read a big chunk of scss to understand what that component does.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
